Pudge practice map is a custom map made for Warcraft III with the intended purpose of helping DotA players better their performance with the hero Pudge in games. This was made a really long time ago when I played DotA obsessively and wanted to improve my skills.

You can find it [here](/assets/bin/Pudge Practice Map v3.3.w3x).
