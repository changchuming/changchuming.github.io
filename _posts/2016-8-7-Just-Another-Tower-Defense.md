This is a semi-complete tower defense game I made a while ago. I am thinking of re-opening this project with a thematic and graphical rehaul. Please let me know if you're interested to collaborate.

Here are some screenshots. The game is available for download on Google Play [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.justanothertowerdefense).
