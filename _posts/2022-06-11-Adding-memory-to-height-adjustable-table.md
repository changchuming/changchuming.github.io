I have a height-adjustable at work, but unfortunately it doesn't have memory. Being the lazy person that I am, I designed and added a memory function to it using a ESP-8266 microcontroller. I also added control via Google Home, but it's not very practical having to reach for my phone in order to adjust my table height. The final product and demonstration is below!

Manual control:

Remote control:

I am too lazy to do a write-up now, but maybe in the future!
