I am running a free electronics workshop for complete beginners. If you ever wanted to find out what goes on behind the scenes in your smartphone, or how to automate simple tasks with electronics, this workshop will be perfect for you. You will acquire a high-level understanding of the basics of electronics, as well as get a hands-on experience with creating and programming an electronic toy.

The sign-up link can be found [here](https://changchuming.typeform.com/to/Vq3dHG).

Everyone will get a set of the components pictured above for the hands-on workshop.

Here is an overview of the topics that I'll cover -


* Bit & bytes
* Highs and lows
* Hands-On
    * Blinking LED
    * Button as input
    * Playing melody

Before coming, it is *very important* that you download and install the following programs.
