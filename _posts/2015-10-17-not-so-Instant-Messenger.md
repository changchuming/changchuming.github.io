not so Instant Messenger is a simple standalone instant messenging program designed to allow users to chat over a network. Users can create a password-protected session within a shared folder, then join and leave the session at will. This was made during national service (NS) so we could chat on a local network with restrictions.

You can find it [here](/assets/bin/nsim_v4.1.zip).
